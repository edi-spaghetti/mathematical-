Recitations
===========

This section contains recitations, which are simpler problems that go over the lecture topics.
The resources for each of the recitations are summarised `here <link https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/recitations/>`_.
In each case, questions are accompanied by staff solutions.
When doing the recitations, I will always attempt the problem first, then check my answers against the solutions.
The important thing is not just getting the right answer, but being able to structure it in my own words to reach the correct answer.
