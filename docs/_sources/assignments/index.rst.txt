Assignments
===========

This section contains assignments, which are more difficult problems that cover topics from `lectures <link https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/video-lectures/>`_ and `reading material <link https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/readings/>`_.
Answers are not provided with the assignments, and I do not currently have anyone to check my work, so really I'm relying on my own understanding.
If you spot something I've done wrong, please let me know!
