<h2>Problem 1<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Let</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ G = (V, E)\ \)</span> <strong>be a graph.</strong>
<strong>A matching in G is a set</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ M \subset E\ \)</span> <strong>such that no two edges in M are incident on a common vertex.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Let</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ M_1, M_2\ \)</span> <strong>be two matchings of G.</strong>
<strong>Consider the new graph</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ G' = (V, M_1 \cup M_2)\)</span>
<strong>(i.e. on the same vertex set, whose edges consist of all the edges that appear in either</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ M_1\)</span> <strong>or</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ M_2\)</span> <strong>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Show that</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ G'\ \)</span> <strong>is bipartite.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Helpful definition: A connected component is a subgraph of a graph consisting of some vertex and every node and edge that is connected to that vertex.</strong></p>
<hr><p>Suppose we have two subsets of nodes, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_L\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_R\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V = V_L \cup V_R\)</span>.
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G'\)</span> is bipartite if every node can be added to either <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_L\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_R\)</span> without sharing an edge with an existing node in that set.</p>
<p>By definition, a matching produces a bipartite graph, because no two edges are incident to a common vertex.
A graph produced from a matching also has a maximum degree of 1, for the same reason.</p>
<p>If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G'\)</span> has a degree of 1, then it is trivially bipartite.
So we must show that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G'\)</span> is bipartite if it has a degree higher than 1.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma 1</strong>: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G'\)</span> has a maximum degree of 2.</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>: By contradiction.
Suppose we have a node, v, in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G'\)</span> incident to edges <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(e_t\)</span> where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ t &gt; 2\)</span>.
By definition of a matching, the vertex (and the edge it is matched with) can appear once and only once per matching.
We also know the edges in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G'\)</span> are a union of exactly two matchings.</p>
<p>So, if t is greater than 2, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(e_1\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(e_2\)</span> could come from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_1\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_2\)</span> respectively,
but <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(e_3\)</span> could not come from either, which is a contradiction.</p>
<p>So we can conclude a graph produced from two matchings will have, at most, degree of 2.
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\square\)</span></p>
<p>Next, let’s consider the connected component of any node in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G'\)</span>.
Suppose we have a node, v, connected by the shortest number of edges to another node, u.
We start by adding v to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_L\)</span>, and for every node in the same component we recursively add every adjacent node to the opposite partition.
This means the number of edges from v to any node in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_L\)</span> will be even, and the number of edges from v to any node in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_R\)</span> will be odd.</p>
<p>A path is bipartite, because each node is present only once, and there are no cycles.
So each node can be grouped by the opposite of its neighbours.</p>
<p>Suppose two adjacent nodes, w and x are both connected to v, forming a cycle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v—...w—x—...v\)</span>.</p>
<p>If the parity of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v—..w\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v—...x\)</span> is different,
then by the above, w and x are in opposite partitions, so the cycle is bipartite.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The sum of numbers of opposite parity is odd, plus 1 (for the edge <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(w—x\)</span>),
meaning this is a cycle of even length.</p>
</div>
<p>If the parity of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v—..w\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v—...x\)</span> is the same, then w and x would be in the same partition.
But since they share an edge they can’t be added to the same partition, and so the graph cannot be bipartite.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The sum of any two numbers of the same parity is always even.</p>
</div>
<p>Since v and w are adjacent, the parity of the number of edges in the the cycle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v—...w—x—...v\)</span> is odd.
So we must prove that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G'\)</span> cannot have any cycles of odd length.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma 2</strong>: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G'\)</span> cannot have any cycles of odd length</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>: By contradiction.
Assume <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G'\)</span> has a cycle of length i, where i is an odd number.
Suppose we walk around the cycle. Since the edges in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G'\)</span> are a union of matchings,
each step must travel along an edge, e, such that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(e_j\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(e_{j+1}\)</span> are from the opposite matching,
for some integer <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j \in \Bbb Z\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is because matchings cannot contain edges connected to a node more than once.
So if a node has more than one edge, they must come from different matchings.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>By lemma 1, we know there are at most 2 edges for every node in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G'\)</span>.
So edges are from either <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_1\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_2\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>This means, for any <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k,m \in \Bbb Z\)</span>, if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ k\ mod\ i\ \)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ m\  mod\ i\ \)</span> are both even, then they must come from the same matching.
However, since i is odd, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ 0\ mod\ i\ \)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ i-1\ mod\ i\ \)</span> are both even, which would put two adjacent edges in the same matching.
This is a contradiction, so we can assume there are no cycles of odd length in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G'\)</span>
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\square\)</span></p>
<p>By lemma 2, we know <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G'\)</span> can only be comprised of paths and even cycles, which as we showed, both result in a bipartite graph.
Therefore, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G'\)</span> is bipartite.
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\blacksquare!\)</span></p>

<h2>Problem 2<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Let</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ G = (V, E)\ \)</span> <strong>be a graph.</strong>
<strong>Recall that the degree of a vertex</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v \in V\ \)</span> <strong>, denoted</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ d_v\ \)</span> <strong>, is the number of vertices w such that there is an edge between v and w.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(a) Prove that</strong></p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[2 |E| = \sum_{v \in V} d_v\]</div>
<hr><p>Every edge in a graph connects one node to another.
In all of these examples we are also assuming simple graphs, i.e. no loops or multi-edges.</p>
<p>Let’s say one of the nodes in G, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_a\)</span>, is connected by an edge to another node, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_b\)</span>.
When we count the degree of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_a\)</span> we get <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_a\)</span>, which includes the edge <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({v_a—v_b}\)</span>
When we come to count the degree of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_b\)</span> we get <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_b\)</span>, and this includes the edge <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({v_b—v_a}\)</span>.</p>
<p>In this way, each edge is counted twice.
Therefore the sum of all the degrees of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v \in V\)</span> is equal to the number of edges multiplied by two.</p>
<p><strong>(b) At a 6.042 ice cream study session (where the ice cream is plentiful and it helps you study too) 111 students showed up.</strong>
<strong>During the session, some students shook hands with each other</strong>
<strong>(everybody being happy and content with the ice-cream and all).</strong>
<strong>Turns out that the University of Chicago did another spectacular study here,</strong>
<strong>and counted that each student shook hands with exactly 17 other students.</strong>
<strong>Can you debunk this too?</strong></p>
<hr><p>Let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G = (V, E)\)</span> be a graph representing the ice cream sticky study shakey handathon session.
Where each node in V represents a student, and each edge in E represents students <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_a\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_b\)</span> shaking hands with each other.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: There cannot exist a graph where each node in V is connected by 17 edges.</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>: By contradiction.</p>
<p>Suppose each student shook hands with 17 other students.
There are 111 students in total multiplied by 17 students = 1887 hand shakes in total.
But a handshake is reciprocal, so to avoid counting it twice we must divide by 2.
But we can’t divide 1887 by 2 because it’s an odd number.
This is contradiction, so we can conclude that the theorem holds.
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\blacksquare\)</span></p>
<p><strong>(c) And on a more dull note, how many edges does</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ K_n\ \)</span> <strong>, the complete graph on n vertices, have?</strong></p>
<hr><p>In an n-node complete graph, every node is connected to every other node.
Again, we’re only considering simple graphs, so no loops or multi-edges.</p>
<p>This means for each node there are <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n - 1\)</span> edges.
Since there are n nodes, then there are <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n \cdot (n - 1)\)</span> edges.
However, that would count edges going both ways, so we need to divide by 2,
giving us <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({n^2 - n \over 2}\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: Let P(n) be the predicate, defined as follows,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[P(n) ::= \forall n \in N_+.\ |E| = {n^2 - n \over 2}\]</div>
<p>That is, for any n-node complete graph <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G = (V, E)\)</span>, the number of edges is calculated as above.</p>
<p><strong>Base Case</strong>: P(1) is true because, there is only one node and we don’t allow loops so there can be zero edges</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[{1^2 - 1 \over 2} = 0\]</div>
<p><strong>Inductive Step</strong>: We must show <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(n + 1)\)</span>, assuming <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(n)\)</span> is true.
First, if we take out the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((n+1)^{th}\)</span> node, and all its edges, we are left with a n-node graph.
By P(n) we can assume how many edges it has.
When we add the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((n+1)^{th}\)</span> node back in, it must be connect to all existing nodes to make a complete graph.
There are n existing nodes, so we can calculate the number of edges as,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}\begin{aligned}\\|E| &amp;= {n^2 - n \over 2} + n \qquad &amp;&amp; \text{ (by inductive hypothesis) } \cr\\&amp;= {n^2 - n \over 2} + {2n \over 2} \qquad &amp;&amp; \text{ (multiply to common factor)} \cr\\&amp;= {n^2 - n + 2n \over 2} \cr\\&amp;= {(n+1) \cdot n \over 2} \cr\\\end{aligned}\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>This proves <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(n+1)\)</span>, and so by induction we can assume the hypothesis is true for all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n \in N_+\)</span>.
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\blacksquare\)</span></p>

<h2>Problem 3<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Two graphs are isomorphic if they are the same up to a relabeling of their vertices (see Definition 5.1.3 in the book).</strong>
<strong>A property of a graph is said to be preserved under isomorphism if whenever G has that property,</strong>
<strong>every graph isomorphic to G also has that property.</strong>
<strong>For example, the property of having five vertices is preserved under isomorphism:</strong>
<strong>if G has five vertices then every graph isomorphic to G also has five vertices.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Some properties of a simple graph, G, are described below.</strong>
<strong>Which of these properties is preserved under isomorphism?</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><strong>G has an even number of vertices.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><hr><p>Preserved, because isomorphism is a bijection between sets of vertices, so the number of vertices cannot change.
If the graph has an even number before applying to function, it will have an even number after applying.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>None of the vertices of G is an even integer.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><hr><p>Not preserved, because the graph isomorphism could be to simply add one, making it odd.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>G has a vertex of degree 3.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><hr><p>Preserved, because the function applied to each vertex is also applied to each vertex adjacent to it.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>G has exactly one vertex of degree 3.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><hr><p>Preserved, for the same reason as in question 3</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Determine which among the four graphs pictured in the Figures are isomorphic.</strong>
<strong>If two of these graphs are isomorphic, describe an isomorphism between them.</strong>
<strong>If they are not, give a property that is preserved under isomorphism such that one graph has the property, but the other does not.</strong>
<strong>For at least one of the properties you choose, prove that it is indeed preserved under isomorphism (you only need prove one of them).</strong></p>
<img alt="../_images/assignment-4-problem-3-part-b.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/assignment-4-problem-3-part-b.png" />
<p>Graphs a and c are isomorphic.</p>
<p>Here is an isomorphism from a to c:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}f(1) = 1\\f(2) = 2\\f(3) = 3\\f(4) = 8\\f(5) = 9\\f(6) = 10\\f(7) = 4\\f(8) = 5\\f(9) = 6\\f(10) = 7\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>To make this a bit more visual, I’ve labelled these with colours:</p>
<img alt="../_images/assignment-4-problem-3-part-b-coloured.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/assignment-4-problem-3-part-b-coloured.png" />
<p>Graph b is not isomorphic to any other, because it has a max degree of 4, but the others all have a max degree of 3.</p>
<p>Graph d is not isomorphic to any other because it has a cycle of length 4, but neither a nor b have a cycle of length 4.
(We already showed b is not isomorphic to d because of the max degree).</p>
<p>The formal definition of isomorphism between two graphs G and H is a bijection <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ f\ :\ V(G) \rightarrow V(H)\)</span> such that,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\langle u — v \rangle \in E(G) \Leftrightarrow \langle f(u) — f(v) \in E(H) \rangle\]</div>
<p>for all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u, v \in V(G)\)</span></p>
<p>This means an isomorphic function is applied to any given node in G to get the corresponding node in H.
It also means the edge between any two nodes in G is also preserved in H.</p>
<p>That is to say, if u is adjacent to v in G, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(u)\)</span> is adjacent to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(v)\)</span> in H.
This means the number of edges does not increase or decrease while performing the isomorphism.</p>
<p>Since the number of edges does not change, it follows that the max degree must also remain the same.</p>

<h2>Problem 4<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Recall that a coloring of a simple graph is an assignment of a color to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.</strong>
<strong>A k-coloring is a coloring that uses at most k colors.</strong></p>
<p><strong>False Claim. Let</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ G\ \)</span> <strong>be a (simple) graph with maximum degree at most</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ k\ \)</span>.
<strong>If</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ G\ \)</span> <strong>also has a vertex of degree less than</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ k\ \)</span> <strong>, then</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ G\ \)</span> <strong>is k-colorable.</strong></p>

<li><p><strong>Give a counterexample to the False Claim when k = 2.</strong></p>

<p>As you can see, maximum degree is 2, and D has a degree less than 2,
but because we have a cycle A-B-C, the graph is not 2-colourable</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Consider the following proof of the False Claim:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Proof. Proof by induction on the number n of vertices:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Induction hypothesis: P(n) is defined to be: Let G be a graph with n vertices and maximum degree at most k.</strong>
<strong>If G also has a vertex of degree less than k, then G is k-colorable.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Base case: (n=1) G has only one vertex and so is 1-colorable. So P(1) holds.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Inductive step: We may assume</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ P(n)\)</span>.
<strong>To prove</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ P(n + 1)\)</span> <strong>, let</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ G_{n+1}\ \)</span> <strong>be a graph with</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ n + 1\ \)</span> <strong>vertices and maximum degree at most k.</strong>
<strong>Also, suppose</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ G_{n+1}\ \)</span> <strong>has a vertex, v, of degree less than k.</strong>
<strong>We need only prove that</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ G_{n+1}\ \)</span> <strong>is k-colorable.</strong></p>
<p><strong>To do this, first remove the vertex</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ v\ \)</span> <strong>to produce a graph,</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ G_n\ \)</span> <strong>, with n vertices.</strong>
<strong>Removing v reduces the degree of all vertices adjacent to v by 1.</strong>
<strong>So in</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ G_n\ \)</span> <strong>, each of these vertices has degree less than k.</strong>
<strong>Also the maximum degree of</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ G_n\ \)</span> <strong>remains at most k.</strong>
<strong>So</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ G_n\ \)</span> <strong>satisfies the conditions of the induction hypothesis P(n).</strong>
<strong>We conclude that</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ G_n\ \)</span> <strong>is k-colorable.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now a k-coloring of</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ G_n\ \)</span> <strong>gives a coloring of all the vertices of</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ G_{n+1}\)</span> <strong>, except for v.</strong>
<strong>Since v has degree less than k, there will be fewer than k colors assigned to the nodes adjacent to v.</strong>
<strong>So among the k possible colors, there will be a color not used to color these adjacent nodes,</strong>
<strong>and this color can be assigned to v to form a k-coloring of</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ G_{n+1}\)</span>.
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\square\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Identify the exact sentence where the proof goes wrong</strong></p>
<hr><p>In <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(n)\)</span>, k is assumed but not defined. For an n-node graph, k scales with n, such that k is at most <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n-1\)</span>,
because each node can be adjacent to at most <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n-1\)</span> other nodes (since loops are not allowed in simple graphs).</p>
<p>This means the base case has not been proved because we don’t know what k is.
If we were assume it was <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n-1\)</span>, then P(1) would have to prove the graph is 0-colourable, which is impossible.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Hint: First show that a line graph is 2-colorable.</strong>
<strong>Note that a line graph is defined as follows:</strong>
<strong>The n-node graph containing n − 1 edges in sequence is known as the line graph</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ L_n\)</span>.</p>
<p>Considering case (a) only, results in a line graph <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_n\)</span>.
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_1\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_n\)</span> have a degree of 1, while all nodes in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((s_2, \dots, s_{n-1})\)</span> have a degree of 2.</p>
<p>Since this forms a path, it is 2-colourable, because nodes are either odd or even, which forms two groups.</p>
<p>When we consider case (b), the graph G has a degree of at most 4.
For any given item in the sequence, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_i\)</span>, if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_i - 1\)</span> is greater than 0, and earlier in the sequence,
then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_i\)</span> will be connected to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_i - 1\)</span>.
If i is greater than 1, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_{i-1}\)</span> will also be connected, because <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_i\)</span> is not the first item of the sequence.
By symmetry, edges are also added if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_i + 1\)</span> is less than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_i\)</span>, or if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i+1 \le n\)</span> (i.e. we haven’t reached the end of the sequence)</p>
<p>In other words, up to 2 edges are added each for numerical and sequential ordering.</p>
<p>So when we added edges by sequential ordering, there are at most 3 existing edges.
Up to 2 from the numerical ordering, and 1 from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{s_k}\)</span>.
Therefore we need at most 1 more colour to colour <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{s_{k+1}}\)</span>, making 4 colours.</p>

<dt><strong>Suppose</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ (s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n) = (1, a_1, 3, a_2, 5, a_3, ...)\ \)</span> <strong>where</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ a_1, a_2\ \)</span> <strong>is an arbitrary distributed sequence of the even numbers in</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ 1, \dots, n − 1\)</span>.</dt><dd><p><strong>Prove that the resulting graph is 2-colorable.</strong></p>
<p>By case (b) we add one edge by sequential ordering, resulting in a line graph.</p>
<p>Then for each number in numerical order, it must be an odd number of places away in the sequence (due to how the sequence is structured).
Therefore the edge added by numerical ordering creates a loop of even length (odd + 1 = even).</p>
<p>As we’ve shown in problem 1, a graph with only cycles of an even length is bipartite, and therefore 2-colourable.</p>
