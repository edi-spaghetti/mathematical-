MIT Math for Computer Science
-----------------------------

Contained in this repo is my coursework for MIT's [math for comp sci](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/index.htm).

I'll be uploading the recitations and assignments here so I can keep track of my progress.
There are final exams which I'll be doing under test conditions, and hopefully find someone to grade it for me.

I'm also building all the coursework with sphinx, you can view it [here](https://edi-spaghetti.github.io/mathematical-/).
