MIT Math for Computer Science
-----------------------------

This isn't strictly a coding project, but I found some resources online, including 
[this math for comp sci](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/index.htm)
course, which I've decided is a key area I need to improve on.

I'll be uploading the recitations and assignments here so I can keep track of my progress.
